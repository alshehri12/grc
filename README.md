# GRC System - Governance, Risk & Compliance Platform

A comprehensive enterprise-grade GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) management system built with Django REST Framework and Vue.js. Designed to help organizations manage their security frameworks, risk assessments, compliance audits, and business continuity planning in one unified platform.

## Why This Project?

Managing GRC activities across multiple spreadsheets and documents is a nightmare. I've seen teams struggle with scattered policies, missed audit deadlines, and risks that slip through the cracks. This platform brings everything together - from your ISO 27001 controls to your business continuity plans - in a single, streamlined interface.

## Key Features

### 🏛️ Governance Module
- Policy lifecycle management (draft → review → approval → publish)
- Procedure documentation linked to policies
- Document repository with version control
- Automated review reminders

![Policies](screenshots/policies.png)

### ⚠️ Risk Management
- Comprehensive risk register
- Risk assessment with likelihood/impact matrix
- Treatment plans and tracking
- Risk acceptance workflow
- Visual risk heatmap

![Risk Matrix](screenshots/risk-matrix.png)

### ✅ Compliance Management
- Multi-framework support (ISO 27001, NCA ECC, SAMA CSF, PDPL)
- Control implementation tracking
- Gap analysis and remediation
- Audit planning and execution
- Evidence collection and management
- Finding tracking with corrective actions

### 🔄 Business Continuity (BCM)
- Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
- Business Continuity Plans (BCP)
- Disaster Recovery Plans (DRP)
- Crisis management with call trees
- Testing and exercise management
- Incident tracking

### 📊 Dashboard & Reporting
- Real-time compliance status
- Risk trends and analytics
- Upcoming deadlines and tasks
- Audit findings summary

## Tech Stack

**Backend:**

## Supported Frameworks

| Framework | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| ISO 27001 | Information Security Management System |
| NCA ECC | Saudi National Cybersecurity Authority - Essential Cybersecurity Controls |
| SAMA CSF | Saudi Central Bank - Cyber Security Framework |
| PDPL | Personal Data Protection Law (Saudi) |

## Language Support

The platform fully supports **English** and **Arabic** languages with complete RTL (Right-to-Left) layout support. Users can switch between languages from the settings page.

## Automation (reminders, escalations, expiries, KPIs)

All recurring GRC housekeeping lives in `grc_system/core/automation.py`:
review reminders (policies, risks, plans, BIAs, control tests), approval SLA
escalation, overdue flags for tasks / findings / corrective actions, evidence
and risk-acceptance expiry, control-derived residual-risk recalculation, gap
assessment refresh, KPI snapshots and e-mail delivery of notifications.

Run it **without Celery** (local development, demos, or a cron entry):

```bash
python manage.py run_automation            # run every job once
python manage.py run_automation --list     # see the jobs
python manage.py run_automation --job expire_evidence --job snapshot_kpis
```

Run it **with Celery** (production): the schedule is defined in
`CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE` (settings.py) and picked up by django-celery-beat.

```bash
celery -A grc_system worker -l info
celery -A grc_system beat -l info
```

E-mail uses Django's `EMAIL_BACKEND` (console output by default; set the
`EMAIL_*` environment variables for SMTP). Users can opt out in their profile.
Thresholds (warning windows, test intervals) are in `GRC_AUTOMATION` and can be
overridden with `GRC_*` environment variables.

### Demo data

```bash
python manage.py seed_demo_data            # realistic bilingual sample data
python manage.py seed_demo_data --reset    # wipe and re-seed
```

## API Documentation

API endpoints follow RESTful conventions:

- `GET /api/risk/risks/` - List all risks
- `POST /api/risk/risks/` - Create new risk
- `GET /api/risk/risks/{id}/` - Get risk details
- `PUT /api/risk/risks/{id}/` - Update risk
- `DELETE /api/risk/risks/{id}/` - Delete risk
- `GET /api/risk/risks/matrix/` - Get risk matrix data
- `GET /api/risk/risks/statistics/` - Get risk statistics

Similar patterns apply to governance, compliance, and bcm modules.

## Default Credentials

After running migrations, create a superuser:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
